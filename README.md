# Satellite Network Predictor - Business Problem
----

The satellite internet services provider, SpaceX Starlink, faces a business problem in improving the quality of service and reducing costs by optimizing the allocation of resources in the satellite network. The company aims to predict the performance of the network under different weather conditions and customer usage patterns, and use these predictions to optimize the allocation of resources to ensure that the network is able to meet customer demands while minimizing costs.

As the Data Engineer and Data Scientist for this project, my responsibilities include designing and implementing a data pipeline that collects and processes data from various sources such as telemetry data, weather data, customer usage data, network configuration data, and demographics data. Additionally, I will be building machine learning models that predict the performance of the network under different conditions, and optimize the allocation of resources.

The success of this project will be measured by the improvement in the quality of service and the reduction in costs. By using data-driven decisions, the company will be able to improve the overall customer experience.
